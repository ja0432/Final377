        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This app helps users choose the right clothes based on real-time weather conditions by providing dynamic outfit suggestions based on the weather forecast.</p>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>The app pulls weather data from the Weather.gov API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather conditions. This information is then processed to suggest appropriate clothing for users based on the current temperature and weather status (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.).</p>
