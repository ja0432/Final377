Title of your project:

What to Wear? 

Description of your project: 

People often have a hard time knowing what to wear when the weather
changes, especially when the temperature is uncertain and constantly fluctuating.
This website is supposed to allow users to input their city and the app will let them know 
what the temperature outside is and then give outfit recommendations. 

Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?)
Anyone with web browsing capabilities should be able to access the website.
