      question: "Why is my city not showing up in the search results?",
      answer:
        "WeatherFit uses the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for geocoding. If your city isn't showing up, try adding the state, province, or country to make your search more specific. For example, instead of 'Springfield,' try 'Springfield, IL' or 'Springfield, USA.'",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the weather forecasts?",
      answer:
        "WeatherFit uses data from the National Weather Service (Weather.gov), which provides official weather forecasts for the United States. These forecasts are generally reliable, but like all weather predictions, they may not always be 100% accurate, especially for forecasts further in the future.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are outfit recommendations determined?",
      answer:
        "Our outfit recommendations are based on temperature ranges and weather conditions. We consider factors like temperature (hot, warm, cool, cold, freezing) and precipitation (clear, rainy) to suggest appropriate clothing. These recommendations are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on your personal preferences and specific activities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does WeatherFit work for international locations?",
      answer:
        "While our location search works worldwide through OpenStreetMap, our weather data comes from the U.S. National Weather Service, which primarily covers the United States and its territories. For international locations, you may receive limited or no weather data.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why am I seeing an error when searching for a location?",
      answer:
        "Errors can occur for several reasons: The location may not be recognized by our geocoding service, the Weather.gov API may be temporarily unavailable, the location may be outside the coverage area of the Weather.gov API, or there might be network connectivity issues. Try searching for a different location or try again later.",
